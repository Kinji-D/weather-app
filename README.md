# Weather App
**Overview -** I built this weather app using HTML/CSS with the React.js framework. I also used an API called OpenWeather from "https://openweathermap.org" to get the weather data. All you have to do is input a location and the data gets pulled from the API and displayed on the screen. Temperature is shown along with the date, high and low temperatures for the day, humidity, "feels like" temperature, wind speed and visibility. You can also switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius if needed.

# Running Instructions
1. Clone the project into your computer and open it with the code editor of your choice
2. Run the commands `npm install` and `npm install vite`
3. Make sure that the files from the remote repo are properly added into your folder (such as vite.config.js)
4. Once everything looks good, simply run `npm run dev` in the terminal and click the localhost link that's generated to access the webpage on your local network
